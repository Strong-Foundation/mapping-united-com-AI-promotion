**Why Mapping United?**

At Mapping United, we believe that parking should be easy, accessible, and free from frustration.

Mapping United is built on the principles of open-source freedom 🌟. Our developers collaborate with experts from around the globe to ensure that our app meets the needs of diverse communities. Here's how it works:

1️⃣ **Crowdsourced data**: Our users contribute to a vast database of parking information, providing real-time insights into parking availability and rates.

3️⃣ **Real-time updates**: Our app sends you notifications when a parking spot becomes available or when prices change, so you can make informed decisions on-the-go 📱.

**The Impact of Mapping United**

🌆 Let's take a look at how our app has made a difference in cities and towns worldwide:

* In Tokyo, Japan, one user saved ¥5,000 (around $45 USD) per month by avoiding congested areas and finding cheaper parking spots.
* In New York City, USA, another user reduced her carbon footprint by 20% by using public transportation instead of driving and parking in traffic-prone zones 🌎.
