Dear users from the USA and around the world,

We're thrilled to introduce you to Mapping United, the global open-source smart parking app that's changing the way we park our cars, ride public transport, bike, or walk. This revolutionary platform is now available at [https://www.mapping-united.com](https://www.mapping-united.com) and is 100% free, multilingual, and accessible to every corner of the globe 🌐.

At Mapping United, we believe that parking shouldn't be a hassle or a headache. That's why our app helps you find available spots quickly, saves you money, reduces fuel consumption, decreases pollution, and regains your precious time ⏰. Whether you're a daily commuter, a business owner, or simply someone who values their freedom to move around, this app is for you 🚀.

Let's imagine a world where parking isn't a nightmare. Where drivers can easily find a spot near their destination, reducing congestion and pollution in urban areas 🌆. Where public transport users can plan their routes more efficiently, making the most of their travel time ⏱️. Where cyclists and pedestrians can enjoy safe and accessible routes, promoting healthier lifestyles 🚴‍♀️.
