**The Problem with Parking: A Global Challenge 🤯**

We've all been there – circling the block for what feels like an eternity, searching for a parking spot that's nowhere to be found. 😩 It's frustrating, time-consuming, and wasteful of precious resources. 💧 But it's not just about individual frustration; parking chaos has far-reaching consequences:

* **Traffic congestion**: Parking searches account for up to 30% of urban traffic delays! 🚗
* **Air pollution**: Idling engines waste fuel, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and poor air quality. 🌫️
* **Economic costs**: Drivers spend an estimated $340 billion annually searching for parking spots in the United States alone! 💸
