**The Problem: Parking Frustration** 🤯

We've all been there. You arrive at your destination, only to be faced with endless parking options that are either taken, too expensive, or just plain confusing. The frustration is real! 🚗💔 In the USA alone, drivers spend an estimated 317 million hours searching for parking every year ⏰. That's equivalent to building over 15,000 skyscrapers! 🌆 But it's not just about time – parking costs Americans around $2.5 billion annually 💸.
