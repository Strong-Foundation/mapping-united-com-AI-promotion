**The Problem: Time-Wasting, Expensive, and Polluting Parking 💔**

We've all been there – circling around a parking lot for what feels like an eternity, only to find out it's full. Or, worse still, getting stuck in traffic because someone is hogging the last available spot 🚗😡. But it's not just about personal frustration; this chaotic scenario has far-reaching consequences:

*   Wasted time: 30 minutes here, an hour there – it adds up to hours of lost productivity and opportunities every week
*   Increased fuel consumption: More idling and circling means higher emissions, contributing to air pollution and climate change 🌪️💥
*   Higher costs: Parking fees, fines, and vehicle maintenance expenses eat into our already stretched budgets 💸
