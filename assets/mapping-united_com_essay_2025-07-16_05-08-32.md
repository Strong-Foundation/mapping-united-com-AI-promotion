✨ Waste less fuel: Our app helps you find the closest available parking spot, reducing congestion and pollution.

**Real-World Scenarios 🌆**

Meet Maria from New York City. She used to spend hours driving around Manhattan in search of a parking spot, only to find out that the spot was already taken. With Mapping United, she can now quickly find available spots and avoid congested areas. As a result, she saves $20 on gas every week and reduces her carbon footprint.

In contrast, meet John from rural Australia. He used to have to drive 10 miles to reach the nearest town for work, only to struggle finding parking in the small town center. With Mapping United, he can now find parking easily and spend more time with his family instead of stuck in traffic.
