What is Mapping United?
------------------------

Mapping United is a global open-source smart parking app that uses AI-powered technology to help users find parking spots quickly, efficiently, and sustainably. Our mission is to empower communities, reduce pollution, and make transportation more accessible for all. 🌈

How Does It Work?
-------------------

Our app uses a combination of data from various sources, including:

1️⃣ Live traffic updates: We collect real-time traffic information from sensors, cameras, and traffic management systems to ensure our users get the most up-to-date parking spot availability.

2️⃣ User feedback: Our app encourages users to share their experiences, helping us refine our algorithm and provide more accurate parking spot recommendations.

3️⃣ Geospatial data: We utilize geospatial data from mapping providers like OpenStreetMap (OSM) and other sources to create detailed maps of parking spots worldwide.

When you open the Mapping United app, you'll see a map view with available parking spots marked. You can filter by location, time of day, and availability, making it easy to find a spot that suits your needs. 📍

Whether you drive, take public transportation, ride a bike, or walk, Mapping United benefits everyone in the following ways:

1️⃣ **Faster parking**: No more circling around looking for a spot! Our app helps you find one quickly, saving you time and reducing frustration. ⏰

2️⃣ **Money savings**: With our app, you'll waste less fuel and save money on gas or public transportation costs. 💸

3️⃣ **Reduced pollution**: By finding parking spots more efficiently, we reduce the need for multiple attempts to find a spot, which means fewer emissions and a cleaner environment. 🌿

4️⃣ **Regained time**: With Mapping United, you'll have more time to focus on what matters most – your daily routine, hobbies, or spending quality time with loved ones. ⏰
