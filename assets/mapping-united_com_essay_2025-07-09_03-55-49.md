Now, let's talk about the real-world impact of our app:

🏙️ In cities like New York City, where parking spots are at a premium, Mapping United can help alleviate traffic congestion and reduce emissions by providing an alternative to circling around. 🌆

🏠 In towns with limited parking options, our app can help residents find parking closer to their homes, reducing the need for long walks or car rides.
