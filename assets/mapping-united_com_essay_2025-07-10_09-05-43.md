The Challenges of Parking: A Global Problem 🤯

Parking can be a nightmare in urban areas, with limited spots, traffic congestion, and frustrated drivers. 💥 But it's not just city dwellers who face this challenge. Rural towns and suburbs also struggle with parking issues, from finding spaces near local businesses to accommodating tourists. 🏞️
