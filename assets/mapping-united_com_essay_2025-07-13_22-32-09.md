**🚗 The Parking Problem: A Global Issue 🌎**

We've all been there – circling the block for what feels like an eternity, searching for a spot that's not only available but also safe. But it's not just about parking; it's about the environment, our health, and our well-being. Did you know that:

* Climate change is responsible for around 14% of global greenhouse gas emissions, with transportation being a significant contributor? 🔥

**💡 Mapping United: The Solution 🌟**

Our open-source smart parking app is more than just a tool – it's a movement. By providing real-time information on available parking spots, traffic congestion, and even bike lanes and pedestrian paths, we're empowering communities to make informed decisions about their transportation habits.
