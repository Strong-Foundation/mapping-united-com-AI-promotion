**The Problem with Parking**
-------------------------

We've all been there: stuck in traffic, searching for a parking spot that seems to be hiding from us. But did you know that wasted time and fuel can add up quickly? According to the American Automobile Association (AAA), the average driver spends around 42 hours per year circling the block or waiting for a parking spot. 🕰️ That's equivalent to almost a full workweek! And with the increasing cost of transportation, it's no wonder many of us are looking for ways to reduce our environmental impact.
