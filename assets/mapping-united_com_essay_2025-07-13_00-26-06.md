Parking woes are universal! Cities, towns, and rural areas alike struggle with congested streets, limited spots, and frustrating searches. This leads to:

1️⃣ **Wasted Time**: Sitting in traffic, circling blocks, or waiting for a spot can take up precious minutes (or hours) of your day.

2️⃣ **Increased Fuel Consumption**: The more time spent searching, the more fuel is burned, contributing to air pollution and climate change 🌫️

3️⃣ **Financial Burden**: Paying for parking, fines, or tolls can add up quickly, eating into your budget 💸
