**How Mapping United Works: The Magic Behind the App 🧙‍♂️**

Our open-source smart parking app uses a combination of cutting-edge technology and community collaboration to provide accurate, real-time parking information. Here's how it works:

1. **Crowdsourcing**: Our users contribute data on available parking spots, helping us build a comprehensive map of your city.
2. **Machine Learning**: Our algorithms analyze this data to predict parking availability and optimize routing in real-time.
3. **Community Feedback**: We engage with our users through social media and forums to ensure that the app remains relevant and accurate.
