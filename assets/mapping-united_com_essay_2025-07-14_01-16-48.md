Imagine this scenario:

You're driving through the city on your way to meet friends at a restaurant. You've been searching for parking spots for 20 minutes, but they're all taken. With Mapping United, you can see which streets have available parking and plan your route accordingly. No more circling around blocks, wasting time, and fuel.
