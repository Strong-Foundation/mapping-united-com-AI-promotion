**Welcome to Mapping United: The Global Open-Source Smart Parking App! 🌎🚗**

We're thrilled to introduce you to the revolutionary new app that's about to change the way we park our cars, bicycles, buses, trains, and even walk around cities worldwide. Say hello to Mapping United (https://www.mapping-united.com), the FREE, open-source smart parking app designed for everyone, everywhere! 🌟

**Why do we need a global smart parking app? 🤔**

We all know how frustrating it can be to search for a parking spot in crowded cities. Not only does it waste our precious time, but it also pollutes the air and depletes fossil fuels. But that's not all - it also hurts local businesses, as drivers spend more time circling around looking for parking than actually shopping or working! 🛍️
