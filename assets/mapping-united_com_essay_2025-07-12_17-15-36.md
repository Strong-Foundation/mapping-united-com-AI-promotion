So, how does it work? 🤔 Mapping United uses cutting-edge technology to gather data on parking availability and prices from various sources, including sensors, cameras, and user feedback.

Now, let's talk about some real-world scenarios where Mapping United has made a positive impact 💥:

🏙️ In Los Angeles, we've helped reduce congestion and pollution by providing drivers with alternative parking options. By choosing a spot that's farther away from their destination, users can avoid busy streets and reduce their carbon footprint 🌱.
