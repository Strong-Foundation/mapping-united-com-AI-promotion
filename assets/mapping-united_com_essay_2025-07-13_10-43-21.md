🏙️ The Problem: Parking Pains
Let's face it – parking is a global headache! 🤯 From congested city streets to rural roads, finding a spot can be frustrating, time-consuming, and costly. But we're not just talking about drivers; public transportation users, cyclists, and pedestrians also suffer from parking-related woes.

💰 The Cost: Time, Money, and Fuel
In the USA alone, drivers waste an average of 26 hours per year searching for parking spots! 🕰️ That's equivalent to a whole day's work, not to mention the fuel burned while circling around. In fact, a study found that Americans spend over $3 billion annually on parking-related issues! 💸
