Welcome, users from the USA and around the world! 👋 We're thrilled to introduce you to Mapping United, the revolutionary open-source smart parking app that's changing the way we navigate our cities, towns, and rural areas. 🚗

At Mapping United, we believe that everyone deserves a stress-free parking experience, regardless of their mode of transportation.

**🚗 How Mapping United Works**

Our innovative app uses real-time data to provide users with accurate information about parking availability in their area. With just a few taps on your screen, you can:

👉 Find available parking spots quickly and easily

Let's take a look at some real-world scenarios where Mapping United has made a positive impact:

* In San Francisco, a busy city with limited parking options, Mapping United helped residents avoid congestion and reduce their carbon footprint.
* In rural areas of Australia, the app enabled farmers to find nearby parking spots for their trucks, reducing the risk of damage and making their daily commutes easier.
