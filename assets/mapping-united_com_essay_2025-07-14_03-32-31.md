**Why do we need Mapping United?**

🤔 Imagine wasting hours circling streets, searching for a parking spot, only to arrive at your destination feeling frustrated and stressed. Or picture the anxiety of arriving late due to traffic congestion caused by overcrowded parking lots. These daily frustrations are not just inconvenient; they have real-world consequences:

1️⃣ **Fuel waste**: Congested roads and excessive driving lead to unnecessary fuel consumption, harming our environment and contributing to climate change 🌡️.

2️⃣ **Air pollution**: The fumes from idling cars contribute significantly to air pollution, causing respiratory problems and other health issues 🚽.

3️⃣ **Lost productivity**: Time spent searching for parking can be better spent on work, family, or hobbies – precious moments we can't get back ⏰.

**But what about those who don’t drive?**

🤝 Don't worry; Mapping United benefits everyone! Whether you ride public transport 🚌, bike 🚴‍♀️, walk 🚶‍♂️, or use another mode of transportation, this app enhances your daily commute. It helps:

2️⃣ **Cyclists and pedestrians**: With real-time data on parking availability, cyclists and pedestrians can plan their route with ease, reducing the risk of accidents or frustration 🚴‍♂️🚶‍♀️.
